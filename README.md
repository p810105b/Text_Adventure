# Text_Adventure

The traditional text adventure game is a game where the program provides a plot and options for actions, and players choose options to act.

This game differs from traditional text adventure games as it uses AI to generate the plot and options. Players can customize the plot theme, such as:
Some specific themes: school romance, jungle adventure, saving the world, conquering the world, survival after doomsday, and daily life.
Some general themes: science fiction, fantasy, magic, suspense, horror, and comedy.
Even some classic novels, comics, and animations can also be used as themes!

Players can also define their own actions instead of being limited to the three options provided by the plot. Additionally, after generating the plot, the game includes illustrations to make the story more vivid and interesting.

In the game, players can:

1.Choose different AI models to generate the plot
2.Decide whether to generate illustrations
3.Decide on their desired plot theme
4.Not enter a theme and allow the generated plot to be random
5.Change the theme during the game
6.Decide the protagonist's name
7.Choose from three different actions
8.Choose to define their own actions
9.Gegenerate the plot after the last action (if unsatisfied with the new plot)
10.Watch ads to support the game creator

When the player closes the game, it automatically saves the progress and allows the player to decide whether to continue the game the next time they play. Before starting the game, the player must obtain an API key from the OpenAI website (instructions are provided in the game). After entering the API key and protagonist name, the game can be started.

Players can speed up the plot generation process by adjusting the model parameters in the game settings. However, if they want a complete and exciting plot, the time to generate it will be longer! Players can also choose to turn off the illustration function to speed up the plot generation process and reduce the cost.

The game provides more detailed instructions within the game itself, so please experience it in the game!
